    "# Why Tuples are Immutable: \n",
    "# Tuples are immutable, which means once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "# This is a fundamental design choice in Python, and it offers several benefits:\n",
    "# 1. Data Integrity: Immutability ensures that the data remains constant and unchanged throughout the program,\n",
    "#    which can help prevent accidental modifications.\n",
    "# 2. Performance: Tuples can be more memory efficient and faster than lists for certain operations,\n",
    "#    as they have a fixed size and structure.   \n",
    "# 3. Hashability: Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, whereas mutable objects like lists cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When Tuples Are Useful:\n",
    "# Tuples are particularly useful in scenarios where a fixed collection of items is needed,\n",
    "# such as representing coordinates (x, y), RGB color values, or any situation where the data should not change. "
